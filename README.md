# Exploring Fundamental and Simple Problems in Physics through Simulations

This project is a collection of my work where I use simulations to explore a wide range of problems in Physics, from the simplest to the most complex. My aim is to bridge the gap between theory and computational modeling, generating insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of physical systems.

## What I Do

I explore various areas of Physics, from classical mechanics to quantum theory and relativity, using simulations to investigate both fundamental and elementary problems. Through detailed simulations and animations, I try to better understand physical phenomena and present them in an intuitive, accessible manner.

## The Approach

- **Physics-Backed Simulations**: Building on well-established theories, I design simulations that offer insights into a variety of physical systems, whether they are simple or complex.
  
- **Animation & Visualization**: The simulations are accompanied by animations that help visualize the physics behind the problems, making abstract concepts easier to grasp.

- **Exploring Various Domains**: My work covers a range of topics, from classical physics to more advanced quantum and relativistic phenomena. Starting with simpler systems, I aim to gradually expand to more intricate models.

## Key Areas of Focus

- **Classical Simulations**: Understanding basic concepts in classical mechanics and observing how physical systems behave under classical laws.
  
- **Quantum Mechanics & Quantum Computing**: Investigating quantum phenomena and developing simulations to better understand quantum systems and their computations.

- **Relativity**: Exploring both special and general relativity through simulations to visualize time dilation, gravity, and spacetime curvature.

- **Advanced Simulations**: Over time, I plan to simulate more complex systems, such as high-energy particle physics models, quantum field theories, and lattice QCD.

## The Vision

My goal is to use simulations to experiment with physical ideas, test hypotheses, and generate results that provide new perspectives. By starting with simpler problems and gradually advancing, I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of both basic and advanced physical phenomena, while making this knowledge accessible to others.
