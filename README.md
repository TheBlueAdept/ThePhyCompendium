# ThePhyCompendium
A compilation of my works and ideas on my quest to solve the most fundamental of problems in all Physics through simulations !

The idea is to use simulations and animations backed by physics theory to come up with new, interestng results. 

Working on all things physics leading from basic simulations to advanced, from classical to quantum to relativistic and much more
